You really love all these people who like you but there's only one person that you want and you know you can't have them all but you want to make everyone happy which really isn't possible at this point. And then there's the people who get hurt because of your decisions, but you want to make them happy too but if you do that then you'll hurt the next person... :( *sigh*	4/10/10 1:51	198	1	1	0	-1

a342998a6b740a278268a9fe5420804b	I'm asking if everyone could please put this as their status for one hour. I know my family will. Think of someone you know or love who has or has had cancer. My prayer is that in 2011 a cure will be found. Will you post it? Just one hour. Do it for all of us. There are too many to mention who have fought and are fighting it, and entirely too many who have lost that fight ... I miss you Grandpa <PROPFIRST> =(	2/24/11 10:35	85	1	1	0	-1

39c4b8555434288fea03015fc909dc3e	has failed :( I must understand that a Jedi is a Jedi, first and foremost, and only. For a Jedi to divide his attention between the will of the Force and the will of others is to invite disaster. If only I was a potential Padawan while I was a young child and not admitted late. :( The attachment to an individual is growing stronger inside of me...and I can't stop it. :(	6/6/10 22:51	326	0	3	0	-3

39c4b8555434288fea03015fc909dc3e	Attachment clouds my vision. People act irrationally and unpredictably when they are emotionally attached to another person or an object. That irrational behavior causes pain, regretted acts, and more irrational behavior when the person or object is threatened. I MUST come to my senses. I MUST be more mindful of my thoughts, because so far, all theyve done is betrayed me. :(	8/18/10 0:01	326	0	1	0	-1
39c4b8555434288fea03015fc909dc3e	Please say something to me. You can't be silent forever. I sense your presence fading...fading. I have said it many times: I'm sorry that I hurt you. It's something I must live with everyday. I don't know what I have done to you. I don't know why you won't speak to me. These are things that I can only ask myself, over and over again. :(	8/20/10 0:36	326	0	1	0	-1
