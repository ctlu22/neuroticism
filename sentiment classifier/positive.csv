450df0fb3d306a11d3715a08946208cf	there comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and the people who create it. You surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good. So love the people who treat you right, pray for those who don't. Life is too short to be anything but happy. Falling down is a part of life. Getting back up is living. stolen from <PROPFEMALE> Armstrong Heinemann :)	2/13/11 7:23	311	1	0	1	1

363073d15ee8aac482a33558392b8e36	The Book of <PROPMALE> is exactly as I've pictured the Christian faith. In fact I was beginning to write something that went somewhat like the Book of <PROPMALE> because I had thought it had never been done before.

363073d15ee8aac482a33558392b8e36	Conservatism has the potential of being so narrow minded that it excludes people. Liberalism has the potential of being so open minded that it is incapable of discerning good from bad. Libertarianism has the potential to do nothing when action is necessary. Authoritarianism has the potential to do too much when no action was needed. \\\

edd7187f82b88e8c1cb2954dc44b0d58	A study revealed that the kind of face a woman finds attractive on a man can differ depending on where she is in her menstrual cycle. If she is ovulating, she is attracted to a man with rugged and masculine features. If she is menstruating or menopausal, she is more attracted to a man with duct tape over his mouth and a spear lodged in his chest while he is on fire. No further studies are expected. - :)	4/26/10 3:58	178	1	0	1	1

5651e94ff56b2549066153a04fe38261	Close your eyes and listen to your heart. No matter how much you feel when it comes to love it will always be your heart that guides you because the mind and it's logic have no place with matters of the heart; and when it comes to emotions, they are just another current in the sea of life you swim; go with them but don't get carried away. They will eventually lead you to something if you swim long enough :).....	7/4/10 3:15	127	1	0	1	1

6a916f8d69ac6f1a1dd56c8d919d1b1f	So the rear hatch latch on the diesel rusted shut because the rear window seal has been leaking water bad - the funny thing is, after penetrating oil and a pair of plyers to get it undone - lithium grease did nothing to fix it. I could open and shut it, but not like it should - the thing that fixed it? GOOD OLD FASHIONED MOTOR OIL, dispensed from an old school pump can. Guess sometimes the old ways are best... :)	4/10/11 2:40	448	0	0	1	1

I don't get holidays, sick pay or ANY days off. I work through the DAY and NIGHT. I am on call ALL hours. Tell me your job is harder than mine.

(2) NOTHING -means SOMETHING & u need to be WORRIED (3) GO AHEAD -this is a dare not permission DO NOT DO IT. (4) WHATEVER -is a woman's way of saying F**K YOU. (5) THAT'S OK -she is thinking long & hard on HOW & WHEN you will pay for your mistake. Re-post if u agree:)	4/1/11 16:20	697	1	0	1	1

There is still no known cure for SDFD & sympathy does not help, but we can raise awareness. 100% of U of A fans will repost this simply because we know how to copy &paste, as well as tie our shoes. :)	12/1/10 4:05	238	1	0	1	1

fb9fcb7873fcda6336e8e86bdd72d2c8	Accepting looks at what it sees w-out judgment,. It doesn't put labels on things. Accepting has friends of every color and religion. It walks on both sides of the tracks. Accepting doesn't decide whether something is good or bad. Accepting allows what is to be what is. :)	5/24/10 21:05	133	1	0	1	1
fb9fcb7873fcda6336e8e86bdd72d2c8	Open-minded is a puppy-eager and ready. It is bright-eyed and alert, knowing that anything it sees or hears or feels or tastes might be wonderous. Open-minded has no shame. It is proud of what it is and accepting of mistakes. Just as it expects to experience life's beauty it knows its own beauty. Open-minded believes there is no point in closing the door on seeing or speaking the truth. :)	6/22/10 13:28	133	1	0	1	1

Put this as your status if you know someone who has or has had depression. Will you do it and leave it on your status for at least an hour? Most people won't, but it's mental health week ...and... 1 in 3 of us will suffer at some point in our lives. Show your support good people :)	11/16/10 18:57	290	1	0	1	1

He usually likes what I cook.   I used to cook for family and friends when we used to have gatherings. I never learned to cook for one. <PROPMALE> only cooks for himself (or two, when his mom was alive), so he doesn't understand why I make something in abundance and freeze it.	10/31/09 0:50	230	1	0	1	1
a95d123f7c698a9dd3820552f9a0ad2d	Try this diet! Take your favorite food and eat it. Eat it until it's coming out your ears. Eat it until there's no room left in your home with the space it takes, and then, when the thought of another ounce makes you sick, toss it out. Don't buy anymore. Imagine just how sick of it you are, and what you wouldn't give for a salad. You might have gained a few lbs., but then you'll be in the clear, and that's good! :-)	11/14/09 5:46	230	1	0	1	1

58eacf81ab350a88db613430af3da6bf	I'm getting a feeling that Maddy is a little angry at me today for pulling a double @work. My new Coach bag (and not a knock-off) was found chewed, torn, and slobbery right next to her leash and my jogging shoes. Last week, one of my favorite bras was chewed to pieces floating in her water dish....I think I may have found a bitch more jealous and vindictive than myself.

In any case, I was totally prepared to kick out the floor board and stop the plane with my heels if the brakes failed!  :) My travel bag didnt make the connection with me, so I guess I will get my stuff back tomorrow.

3cde9151fdd376ed1ee22d30221fb707	Love doesn't exist and is not an emotion. It is a chemical and physiological process in the brain, reptilian brain (caudate nucleus) that causes the feeling of infatuation because of the release of PEA molecules into the CNS which in turn releases dopamine and hinders the release of seratonin.

Eat a box of chocolates 'cause you're feelin' bad? \\\
Do you paint your toes 'cause you bite your nails? \\\
Call up momma when all else fails? \\\
Who are you when I'm not around? \\\
When the door is locked and the shades are down? \\\
Do you listen to your music quietly? \\\
And when it feels just right, are you thinkin' of me? <3\\\

8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	Just narrated two epic games of mafia, won a crazy Foosball (sp?) battle, barely beat a worthy opponent in a chess match, and played two huge games of apples-to-apples, winning one, losing the other.  Oh and there were a couple awesome games of ninja too.  All in all, a good night's work. :)	7/22/10 5:51	157	0	0	1	1
8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	Starcraft II: Wings of <PROPFEMALE> was released today!!! :D\\\
About time!  Gamers have waited over a decade for this! \\\
Remember this day.  For gamers, this game's release is a more important event than Obama's election.\\\

8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	There are few things more satisfying than singlehandedly taking on three very skilled allied enemies in multiplayer Starcraft, and pwning them!  That's right, 3 against 1, and I still won! :D\\\

Thanks for the awesome game, enemy team of <PROPMALE> <PROPMALE>, <PROPMALE> <PROPMALE>, and <PROPFIRST> Colacchia!  Better luck next time! >:)	9/18/10 18:37	157	0	0	1	1

8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	saw Megamind, that new Dreamworks movie based on the premise of a supervillain who actually manages to defeat the superhero and finds out evil isn't all it's cracked up to be.  I thought it had a better plot and better themes than Tangled, but Tangled was funnier and just generally more well-made.  :)	11/28/10 6:18	157	0	0	1	1

8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	Fabio won Survivor!  SO happy!  He was the only one that deserved it.  (and he's a crazy surfer dude, so that's saying a lot about his competition.)  If anyone else had won I would have screamed and thrown the tv away.  Well, actually, that's a huge exaggeration.  I probably would have just fumed for a short while then forgot all about it.  But the previous statement gets my point across more dramatically.  :)	12/20/10 8:48	157	0	0	1	1
8cd9a1fc75de4ced35dfac5d8bee1256	Wow.  Just saw the pilot episodes of the original Battlestar Galactica series.  That's one Sci-Fi show that does not age gracefully, let me tell you.  XD\\\

a122cc9043dd7a49cd7c327d45167524	FB is being ridiculous.  It has blocked my ability to reply to all of your lovely messages.  I thank you all for the support.  It it much appreciated.  <3  :)	7/15/11 14:15	7	1	0	1	1
a122cc9043dd7a49cd7c327d45167524	Please remember to remove my <PROPFEMALE> <PROPMALE> account from your friends lists, if you haven't already.  I've done all I can to block her from this account and to hide what won't be suspicious on the other account, but it seems it would be safer to simply remove all possibilities of an accidental post to the wrong account.\\\
