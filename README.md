# neuroticism

This project predicts whether a Facebook user is neurotic based on their Facebook statuses. The data is collected by myPersonality app (available for researchers). Each myPersonality user filled out a questionaire (big five personality test) and neuroticism score is computed based on the score of the questionaire. Besides the basic features and sentiment features listed on the repository, the model also includes topic features (generated by Mallet) and the training is done on Weka. This repo contains Python code only.
